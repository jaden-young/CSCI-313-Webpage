        <h2>Player POV</h2>
         <p> The avatar gets hits by an enemy. If there is a current PowerUp effect, the avatar will lose the PowerUp and start to fade in and out for 2 seconds.
	    If there is not a PowerUp, the avatar will die(showing death effect/sound). Then he will restart the level at the starting point.
