Displays an overall diagram of the entire level and its interactions with different parts. 
This does classify all structures into one catergory (rather than one for floating and nonfloating). It also includes the GameManager which will be used in order to access different levels
unlike the LevelManager which will be used to access only things at this level. It also shows how the LevelManage will initialize all the 
componets.
