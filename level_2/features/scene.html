    <h1>Level 2 - Side Scroller</h1>
    <hr><i>Game layout and map</i></hr>
    <p>
      The above image will be the map layout for the side scroller. There is a
      key to describe some of the objects. The player will start on the far
      left and work their way right. Once they reach the door, they will enter
      and move on to the next level, which is the Battle. All of the rectangles
      will be made out of brick, and a darker color to them. This way we keep
      with the castle theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, the player will be required to do a variety of jumps,
      such as wall jump and double jumps. Keep in mind there is room for
      possible variation in length of the level down the road (make it longer
      or shorter). As well as change in structures (may or may not have time to do falling structures).
