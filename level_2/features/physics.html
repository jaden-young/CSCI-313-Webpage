      The character will be able to jump, double jump and wall jump.
      All of these will be based off of gravity and force will be applied in
      a horizontal direction when wall jumping. Falling objects such as false
      floors will also be based off of physics, as they fall, if they hit
      anything they will react properly like they would in real life when
      coming in contact with other objects.

      Pictured below is an illustration of jumping, double jumping and wall
      jumping.
