    <h4>Website</h4>
    <p>
      When our group first started working on the documentation, we elected to
      use Google Docs to edit the pages. I was responsible for the initial 
      format of the pages and structure of the site. Also, since the pages
      were saved as .docx, I was tasked with downloading them, converting them
      to html files, and submitting them (nothing a little bash magic couldn't
      handle). 
    </p>
    <p>
      I also made the sidebar navigation for all level's 
      <a href="../level_5/features/index.html">Feature</a> pages. I wish
      that the school server supported <em>something</em> in the way of 
      templating/includes/etc, I sorely regret doing all of that copy and 
      pasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 11:45 p.m. 5/5/2016 I made all updates from the original version
      of all part and scenario pages for level 5. Any page with a hyperlink, 
      I edited. I did everything under the "Actual" heading in parts pages.
    </p>
    <h4>Unity Editor</h4>
    <p>
      I created the <a href="../level_5/parts/avatar.html">Player</a> by 
      attaching the <a href="../level_5/parts/sword.html">sword</a> and 
      <a href="../level_5/parts/shield.html">shield</a> from the 
      <a href="../assets/index.html">knight</a> asset found in the root asset 
      folder to a FirstPersonCharacter prefab from the Unity standard assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      I configured the hitbox of the 
      <a href="../level_5/parts/dragon.html">dragon</a>
      by attaching multiple box colliders to different bones of its armature,
      allowing them to follow the dragon during animations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I configured the Dragon's flight path using the
      <a href="http://itween.pixelplacement.com/index.php">iTween</a> library.
    </p>
    <h4>Code</h4>
    <p>
      I wrote every line of code for the custom scripts in level 5. Every item
      in the <a href="../level_5/parts/index.html">Parts</a> section has a 
      script attached to it that is described in its page, excluding the 
      unimplemented Torch part.
