<p>Animations - Using a sprite sheet, I generated a loop in order to cycle through the sprites for both walking and idle animations. Also 
added a flipping method, which would cause the sprite to flip based on the direction it was walking. This meant changing the center point for every 
sprite by hand. The animation is a component of the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a>.</p>

<p>Animator - Animator will switch back and forth between the walking animation and the idle animation of a sprite. It is set to switch 
when a speed variable is above 0. This is also part of the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a>.</p>

<p>Enemy Collisions - I used a box collider to check for collisions between the player and enemy ghost.This will also
include a collision between the player and the lava. Both the lava and the enemy ghost have their own box collider to check for collisions.
To be able to do this, I had to use both the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a> 
and <a href="../level_2/parts/part_5.html">enemy asset</a>.</p>

<p>Killing enemy - The player has a second box collider that is positioned on the bottom of the sprite. This way when the player falls on
top of the enemy, it will register a collision allowing me to disable the enemy ghost. This used both the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a> 
and <a href="../level_2/parts/part_5.html">enemy asset</a>.</p>

<p>Game Over UI - When a player either runs into an enemy or falls into the water, the enemy collision box will dectect the collision and 
will activate the Game Over UI, which displays the text Game Over as well as a button which will return the you to the main page.
This used both the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a> 
and <a href="../level_2/parts/part_5.html">enemy asset</a>. </p>

<p>Winner UI - When the player collides with the chest at the end of the level, the Winner UI will activate displaying the text Winner and
 a button which will return you to the main page. This used the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a>. </p>

<p>Camera Controller - Short feature which sets the camera's position to the same as the player's position.
 This used the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a>. </p>

<p>Player Movement(Removed) - I had originally worked on the player movement, however it turned out to be glitchy. The avatar would end up
getting randomly stuck on the floor, and also got stuck on the side of walls. We decided to remove this feature and go in a different direction
for player movement which Kevin completed. This used the <a href="../level_2/parts/part_1.html">player asset</a>. </p>
