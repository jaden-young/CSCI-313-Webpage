The <a href="../level_1/parts/part_1.html">Car</a> object was created using a prefab as the template. The car was made of three layers of components, the main body, the axles, and the tires. The main body consisted of two box colliders stacked on top of each other combined with a rigidbody to apply gravity to the entire object. There were two axles (front and back) connected to the car to help prevent the car from tipping while it would turn. The tires were attached to their respective axles and were given wheel colliders to detect the surface below it.
</p>
<p><p>
The entire Car was scripted with multiple scripts including a motor script and turn script, the axles were scripted with an axle script, and the tires had a rotate script. The motor script was contained code to allow the car to move forward and backward. This script also had a property, motor power, that allowed the car's top speed to be increased and set from Unity. The turn script allowed the car to turn right and left and also had a property, turn power, that allowed the car's turn power to be increased to enable tighter turns. The axles contained a script that allowed them to balance the forces of the two tires attached to it to keep the car from rolling over. This script allowed the car to take tighter turns without the worry of the car tipping. The tire script contained code that allowed the tires to rotate and appear to turn with the car.

Menus were created using Unity's UI functions. The script involved with this allowed the buttons to appear and disappear upon clicking them and it also was able to transition between the multiple scenes used for the Racer game.

The <a href="../level_1/parts/part_2.html">Timer</a> was created using a simple script that utilized Unity's internal clock to keep track of seconds as it counted down from a value that was chosen after testing the length of the race. Unity's UI allowed me to put easily display the timer on the screen with a simple line of code.

Transitions (<a href="../level_1/scenarios/scenario_7.html">winning & losing</a>) were written as part of the script for the menus.
