The <a href="../level_1/parts/TrackandScene.html">RaceTrack Model</a> was completely made using the modeling program blender. Basically by starting with a flat cube and extending the one side of it continuously and adjusting length and angle each time it was extended is how the track was created. I also created a duplicate track with all the walls raised along the edges and made it invisible in unity and added a collider to it to make the scenario of driving into the grass not possible.

The basic <a href="../level_1/parts/TrackandScene.html">game scene</a> that you see was created completely inside unity. I started with the default terrain game asset. I imported the racetrack model into unity to make a different surface to work with and add texture to. All the hills and mountains were created with the raise terrain feature in unity. To cut down on time and to make everything look the same an objects package was purchased from the unity store that included all the buildings, trees, etc. on the map. Colliders were added to all the objects on the map but were not needed because of a feature we cut out.

The <a href="../level_1/parts/TrackandScene.html">ranch bottles</a> in are game originally were going to be throughout the race for the player to pick up as a way to add score and time on the clock. I made the simple rotation script to make them float and rotate as well as the script to make them disappear when collected, which was later implemented to end the game.
