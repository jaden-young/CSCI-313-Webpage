<p> I created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_10.html">Minesweeper Grid</a> object. I created an empty object for the grid which was turned into a prefab so that it could generate the tiles within it. I made/coded the script that went with the grid object.
<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_11.html">Minesweeper Tile</a> Object. I created a 3D cube object for the tile which was turned into a prefab. I made/coded the script that went with the tile object as well as created the materials that went with the tile object. The three materials that I created were for the tile lighting up, the tile being vacant, and the tile being uncovered.  
<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_12.html">Minesweeper Main Menu</a>. I created a 3D plane object for the main menu and I used a 3D text object to type the instructions for the game. I also made/coded the script that went with the main menu, and that included a material which was used for the 3D text object, as well as buttons for starting the game or returning to the overall main menu.
<p>
<p>I contributed to <a href="../level_4/features/scene.html">the Scene page</a> of our games. I wrote about how the scene would be layed out in the Minesweeper game and I drew the layout of the scene. 
<p>
<p>I contributed to <a href="../level_4/features/objects.html">the Objects page</a> of our games. I wrote about all of the objects that would be used in the Minesweeper game.
<p>
<p>I updated <a href="../level_4/features/events.html">the Events page</a> of our games. I updated all of the information about the events that took place in the Minesweeper game.  
<p>

<p>
<p>I contributed to <a href="../level_4/features/rules_and_objectives.html">the Rules and Objectives page</a> of our games. I wrote about all of the rules and overall objectives related to the Minesweeper game.

<p>
<p>Initially, I was supposed to create a Memory game for our set of puzzles. For our first, second, and third step, the features, the scenarios, and the parts/assets pages had content regarding how the Memory game was going to be implemented. But due to time restrictions as well as difficulties with the materials, I decided to create another puzzle that would also utilize a grid just like the Memory game. So that is why I decided to create the Minesweeper game. And because of that change, I had to update a lot of the content that was on the pages to reflect that change. 
<p>
<p>I also made sure to perform tests on all of my scripts/objects to make sure that they were working and interacting properly, especially with the time limit which I implemented a little after I completed a majority of the game.
