<p>
<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_3/parts/part_1.html">player avatar</a> object. I ended up using a <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/15209">knight model</a> from the unity asset store and modified it to have it function <br/>
and move via clicking to move as well as programming the keybinds for attacking and spellcasting.<br/>
As another note - I configured the avatar's health point and mana point trackers and their regenerative properties.
<p>
<p> I also created the <a href="../level_3/parts/part_2.html">power up</a> objects. I created spheres and colored them red, blue and white in correspondence with their effects (health, mana, then health and mana respectively). <br/>
Also placed them at random spots on the map.
<p> 
<p> Also created the arena, and was in charge of placement of various textured <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/2452">rock</a> objects.
<p>
<p> Finally I was in charge of implementing the user interface and all its instruction along with the addition of background music, which was a sound file from another game entitled "Kingdom Hearts".
<p>
<p> To note: I performed maintenance on a variety of already completed scripts, mainly with enemy health management, physics, as well as coordinating and linking the enemy script to our player script.
