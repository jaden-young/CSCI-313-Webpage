<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_9.html">Simon Button</a> Objects. I used a cube object and transformed it to the desired shape. I coded all the scripts for this object and I created the materials needed for these objects.
<p>
<p> I also created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_8.html">Simon Board</a> Object. I used a cylinder object and transformed it t the desired shape. I coded all the scripts for this object and I created the material needed for this object.
<p>
<p> I also created the main menu and its components which include the <a href="../overall/parts/part_2.html">Buttons</a> and <a href="../overall/parts/part_1.html">Canvas</a>. I didn't makes these objects in unity as they were already there but I added the functionality that we needed for it to work with our game.
<p>
<p>I helped work on the maze which we didn't end up completing or using. The physical maze was imported from the Asset store but we (Victoria and I) tried to add the functionality of when the player collides with a door in the maze, the puzzle would be activated and played. We ended up not having time to finish it and so it was never added to the end game.
