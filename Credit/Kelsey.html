<h3>Kelsey Bedard's Credit Page</h3>
<p>
<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_9.html">Simon Button</a> Objects. I used a cube object and transformed it to the desired shape. I coded all the scripts for this object and I created the materials needed for these objects.
<p>
<p> I also created the <a href="../level_4/parts/part_8.html">Simon Board</a> Object. I used a cylinder object and transformed it t the desired shape. I coded all the scripts for this object and I created the material needed for this object. 
<p>
<p> I also created the main menu and its components which include the <a href="../overall/parts/part_2.html">Buttons</a> and <a href="../overall/parts/part_1.html">Canvas</a>. I didn't makes these objects in unity as they were already there but I added the functionality that we needed for it to work with our game.
