<h3>Victor Rauta's Credit Page</h3>
<p>
<p>
<p> I created the <a href="../level_3/parts/part_3.html">Enemy</a> object. I used a <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1818">skeleton</a> from the unity asset store and used the dark skeleton model. <br/>
and made it able to follow the player.<br/>
<p>
<p> I also used the <a href="../level_3/parts/part_1.html">Avatar</a> object. I used animations that Weston had configured in order to correspond with the player attacking an enemy and the attack removing health from the enemy.
<p> 
<p> I also configured the enemy AI to attack and follow the player, along with balancing damage values on the enemy and player attacks in order to make for a fair gameplay experience. I also configured the skeleton's animations to work with various actions such as attacking, taking damage, etc.
<p>
<p>In addition to all of things stated above I also worked alongside with Weston on making the <a href="../level_3/parts/part_1.html">Q spell</a> work. I was particularly in charge of making the Q spell damage the enemies and trigger their animations.
