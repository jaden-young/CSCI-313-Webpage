  <h1>Level 3-Battle</h1>
  <h3> Player Dies</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Presepective </i></h4>
  <p>The player has had their health bar depleted through being attacked by enemies and has died.
  <p>Through this,
  the live count on the top of the screen is decreased by one and the player despawns and<br/> respawns back at the center of the arena
  at the beginning of the current wave. If all lives are lost, the player is sent to level 1 of the game.
