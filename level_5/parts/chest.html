  <h1>Chest</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    The chest has a box collider marked as a trigger attached to it, so that
    we can open the chest when the player comes into range.
  </p>
  <h3>Variables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>- BottleOfRanchController Script - Reference to ranch controller 
        so that we can play its animation, making it rise out of the chest
        </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>- void OnTriggerEnter (Collier other): Uses Unity's tag system to
      determine if it was the player that came in to range. If it was,
      opens the chest and raises the ranch bottle up, playing
      appropriate sound effects.</li>
  </ul>
