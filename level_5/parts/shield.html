  <h1>Shield</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    The shield is attached as a child object of the Player game object
    in the Unity editor. Since we handled the sword and shield as 
    independently, each needed their own scripts and animations. We used
    the shield model from the knight asset from the asset store, while
    making our own custom animations and animation events.
  </p>
  <p>Components of Shield:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Animator - Controls the shield animation. Only used when called by
      PlayerDefend script.</li>
    <li>PlayerDefend Script - Simple script that controls raising the shield.
      </li>
    <ul>
      <li>- <a href="../parts/avatar.html">PlayerHealth</a> - Reference to
        player health script so we can set its isBlocking variable.</li>
      <li>- void <a href="../scenarios/scenario_18.html">SetIsBlocking</a>
        (int) - Called by Animation Events at the
        beginning and end of shield raising animation.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
