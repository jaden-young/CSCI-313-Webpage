  <h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    The main player avatar is actually just an invisible capsule collider. Since 
    we went with a first person view, rendering the knight model was unnecessary.
    Controlling the player is handled by the stock FirstPersonController 
    available in the Unity Standard Assets. The sword and the shield are child
    objects of the player, causing them to move along with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not having much experience with Unity, the actual implementation varied quite
    a bit from the original design. Since we used independent models for the
    sword and shield, their functionality is handled in their own scripts. Since
    they were seperate models, we needed to animate and control them
    independently.
  </p>
  <p>The components of the parent Player object:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CharacterController.html">
      Character Controller</a> - This is part of the package provided by 
        the unity standard assets.</li>
    <li>First Person Controller Script - Script provided by standard asset 
        package that controls character movement.</li>
    <li>Audio Source - Handles playing audio from the location of the player.
        Sounds include player being hit by an attack, player dying, footsetps,
        and the player's shield being hit.</li>
    <li>Capsule Collider - Player's hitbox, also prevents player from running
        through walls or through the dragon.</li>
    <a class="hidden-link" name="player_health"></a>
    <li>Player Health Script - Controls playing the above audio and taking
        damage, including the player's health bar seen on screen. Important 
        components:</li>
    <ul>
      <a class="hidden-link" name="isBocking"></a>
      <li>+ bool isBlocking - This is set in the script attached to the 
          player's <a href="shield.html">shield</a>. If the player is blocking, 
          damage taken is reduced by half.</li>
      <li>+ bool isDead - This is accessed by the 
        <a href="level_five_manager.html">LevelFiveManager</a>
        script to end the game when the player dies.</li>
      <a class="hidden-link" name="take_damage"></a>
      <li>- void <a href="../scenarios/scenario_17.html">TakeDamage</a> (int) - 
          This is private because it is never
          called directly. We take advantage of Unity's message and tag system
          for dealing damage. When the player enters the box colliders marked as
          triggers attached to the dragon while it is attacking, the dragon 
          checks to see if the object that it hit is tagged as a player. If it is,
          it sends a message to the player, telling it to look for a script 
          attached to it that has a method called TakeDamage, and pass a certain
          amount to it. This allows for an extensible combat system without each
          individual object requiring a reference to everything it could possibly
          deal damage to.</li>
