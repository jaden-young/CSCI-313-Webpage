  <h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    One of the first problems we ran into with the dragon is that Blender
    uses the 3D coordinate system with the z-axis facing up, standard in
    mathematical and engineering fields, while Unity has the y-axis pointing
    up. This caused all sorts of havoc, making coordinates and rotations
    a nightmare. The solution to the problem was surprisingly simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this issue, the actual dragon is a child of an empty game
    object, allowing us to attach components to the empty parent
    that would adhere to Unity's coordinate system, dragging the dragon
    along with it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Colliders and triggers are attached to the actual
    dragon object. They are placed on different pieces of the dragons
    armature, or bone structure, so that they will follow their 
    respective body parts during animations. 
  </p> 
  <p>Components attached to the parent object are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nav Mesh Agent - After configuring which objects and areas we want
      to allow our AI to walk on, Unity can bake a Naviagtion Mesh into the
      scene. This is a rather complicated data structure that is used to
      simplify AI movement and pathfinding. Using the Agent attached to our 
      dragon, we can dynamically calculate the optimal route to reach our
      destination while avoiding obstacles and staying within the area we
      want to.</li>
    <li>Animator - This controls playing animations created for the dragon.
      Animations we used were created in Blender. It contains a reference to
      a Controller, which contains the list of animations and their
      interactions. Action is only taken when called by the DragonAI
      script.</li>
    <li>Rigidbody - Dragon's rigidbody is marked as Kinematic, meaning that 
      it is largely ignored by the physics engine, leaving movement entirely
      up to scripting and animations.</li>
    <li>Audio Source - Allows the dragon to play audio.</li>
    <li>ITweenPath Script - Script from the 
      <a href="http://itween.pixelplacement.com/index.php">ITween Library</a>      available on the
      Unity Asset Store, that is responsible for the dragon's flight 
      path. Allows us to visually configure a path in the Unity editor
      instead of manually entering the coordinates of waypoints.
      Also automatically crates curves inbetween waypoints.</li>
    <li>DragonAI Script - This is responsible for controlling everything
      that the dragon does. Important components:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>- GateController Script - Reference to the script controlling the
        gate, so that we can tell it to open the gate when the dragon
        dies.</li>
      <li>- bool isAttacking - This is used so that we don't deal damage
        every time the player enters the dragons attack hit box, only 
        when we are actually performing an attack.</li>
      <li>+ Slider dragonHealthSlider - Reference to the Slider UI element,
        used to adjust the value visible to the player.</li>
      <li>- void OnTriggerEnter (Collider) - This method is called when an
        object enteres a collider marked as a trigger, i.e. our attack
        hitboxes. In Unity, regular 
        colliders are solid objects that can't be passed through. We wanted
        to give our dragon's attacks a bit of a wider range, while not
        making an invisible wall for the player to run into. Colliders
        marked as triggers, however,  are ignored by the physics engine and 
        are able to be moved through, giving us exactly what we need.
        If the object our attack hit was the player, we use Unity's 
        message system to tell the player to look for a script that
        has a TakeDamage method and pass in our damage.</li>
      <li>+ SetIsAttacking (int) - In Unity, it is possible to create Events
        at certain frames on animations. These events can be used to call
        methods on scripts that are attached to the same object as the 
        animation's Animator. There are events at the beginning and end of
        each attack animation, setting this value accordingly. Unfortunately,
        the events do not support passing boolean values, so we use an int
        here to set our boolean isAttacking.</li>
      <li>- void RotateTowards (Vector3) - This method is used when the 
        player is in attack range, but not in front of us (within 45 
        degrees). When using the NavMeshAgent, the dragon actually moves
        towards the player while rotating. We want the dragon here to stay
        in place while rotating towards the player.</li>
      <li>- void Fly () - Causes the dragon to take off and fly around
        its predetermined flight path.</li>
      <li>- void Roar () - Causes the dragon to roar, playing the 
        appropriate animation and sound effect.</li>
      <li>- void Chase () - Uses the NavMeshAgent to move towards
        the player.</li>
      <li>- void HeadSwipe () - Executes head swipe attack.</li>
      <li>- void FlutterKick () - Executes flutter kick attack</li>
      <li>- void TakeDamage (int) - Called by Unity's message system
        when the player's sword attacks the dragon. Decreases dragon's
        health by specified amount, also adjusting the Slider UI
        element.</li>
      <li>- void Death () - Stops the dragon from moving and plays 
        death animation.</li>
