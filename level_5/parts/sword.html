 <h1>Sword</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Origional</h2>
 <h3>Variables</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>+ bool isAttacking: Tells whether the player is currently attacking. Don't want 
   collision damage to occur just from sword touching dragon.</li>
   <li>+ int damage: Value of damage sword should inflict on an attack</li>
   <li>+ bool Visible: Tells whether the sword is visible (C# Property)</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Methods</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>onCollision(object collider): Checks to see if player is currently attacking. If so, and the sword
   collides with the dragon or destructible objects such as torches, inflict damage.</li>
   <li>+ Visible set method(bool vis): Sets sword visibility (for when player switches weapons)</li>
 </ul>
 <hr>
 <h2>Actual</h2>
 <p>
   We used the sword model found in our Knight from the asset store, with
   own custom animations. The sword is set as a child object of the Player,
   keeping its position locked as if the player were holding the sword.
 </p>
 <p>Unity components attached to the sword:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Rigidbody - Used so that our collisions register with the physics
     engine.</li>
   <li>Box Collider - The swords hit box. This is actually attached to a
     bone in the armature of the sword model, instead of the parent object,
     so that the collider follows the sword during the swing animation.</li>
   <li>Audio Source - Allows the sword to play audio.</li>
   <li>Animator - Holds information regarding animating the sword.
     Animations only play when called by the Player Attack script.</li>
   <a class="hidden-link" name="player_attack"></a>
   <li>PlayerAttack Script - Controls swinging the sword and dealing 
     damage. Important components:</li>
   <ul>
     <li>- bool isAttacking - Tells whether player is currently swinging
       the sword.</li>
     <li>- void <a href="../scenarios/scenario_4.html">OnCollisionEnter</a>
       (Collision) - Called whenever the swords box collider collides with 
       an object.</li>
     <li>- void Attack () - Causes player to swing sword, playing appropriate
       sound effects.</li>
     <li>- void SetIsAttacking () - Sets a private boolean value to determine
       if the player is currently attacking (so we don't deal damage just
       from the sword touching the dragon, only when we're swinging the
       sword). Set by 
       <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/animeditor-AnimationEvents.html">Animation Events</a>
       in the sword model's animations.</li>
   </ul>
