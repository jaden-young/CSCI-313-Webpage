  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <img src="../Images/scenario_11.png" alt="">
  <p>
    On a collision between the player avatar and the FireAOE objects damageRadius,
    the FireAOE will pass data to the avatar's takeDamage method, including
    total damage, duration, and rate at which to apply. On a collision the
    FireAOE will also play a burning sound, and the system will call a method
    "burn" to show burning embers and smoke on the camera.
