  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    The PlayerDefend script located in player's 
    <a href="../parts/shield.html">shield</a> will play its raise animation.
    This animation has animation events set in it to set the isBlocking
    boolean variable of the 
    <a href="../parts/avatar.html#player_health">PlayerHealth</a>
    script attached to the parent Player object. Whether the player is
    blocking or not affects 
    <a href="scenario_17.html">how much damage they take</a>
