  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    Again, we make use of Unity's tag and message system. When the player
    is hit by an attack from the Dragon, its
    <a href="../parts/dragon.html#on_trigger_enter">OnTriggerEnter</a> method 
    is called. The dragon then uses the 
    <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SendMessage.html">SendMessage</a>
    method to tell our player's 
    <a href="../parts/avatar#player_health.html">PlayerHealth</a>
    script to take the specified amount of damage.
    If the player's <a href="../parts/shield.html">shield</a> has told the
    PlayerHealth script that we are currently blocking, that damage
    is to be reduced by half. The PlayerHealth script then updates the 
    <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Slider.html">slider</a>
    UI element representing the player's health.
