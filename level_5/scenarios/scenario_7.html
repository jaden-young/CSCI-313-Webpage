  <h1>Level 5 - Boss Battle</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3><i>Player's health gets reduced to 0 or less</i></h3>
  <h2>Original</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Battle music ends</li>
    <li>Death animation and camera pans out to see the player's body laying on the ground and the dragon shaking it's head, spitting fire and ending with the dragon roaring</li>
    <li>Player loses a life</li>
    <li>If player has a remaining life, they start the level over Dragon back to full health Scenario 1 occurs again</li>
    <li>If player has no lives remaining they are shown a game over screen and returned to the main menu</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
	<img src="Images/L6-Scenario 7.png" width=50%>
  <h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    Since we went with an arcade style game instead of our game being a 
    linear progression, we opted against having lives. Instead, the player
    is simply returned to the main menu upon death. 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Player death sound effect plays</li>
    <li>Screen goes red</li>
    <li>Player is returned to main menu</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    Dealing damage to the player is handled by the 
    <a href="../parts/avatar.html#take_damage">TakeDamage</a> method located
    in the player (avatar) object. When the player reaches 0 health, the 
    <a href="../parts/level_five_manager.html">LevelFiveManager</a>
    script will end the game.
