  <h3><i>Player moves around in the level</i></h3>
  <h2>Original</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The dragon's head tracks the player</li>
    <li>The dragon slowly walks toward the player's position, but stays within a designated radius of its original position</li>
    <li>A fireball gets shot from the dragon's mouth periodically at the player</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>

	<h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    We don't have the dragon's head tracking the player, instead the
    dragon's entire body follows the player as it moves. We also removed
    the restriction on having the dragon stay close to the gate, it will
    instead follow the player all over the arena. There is no escape from
    Terry the Terrible.
  </p>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    Player is controlled by the 
    <a href="../parts/Avatar">FirstPersonController</a> script attached to
    the player. Uses standard controls, wasd, shift for sprint, space
    for jump.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dragon moving towards the player is handled by the Chase method in
    the <a href="../parts/Dragon">DragonAI</a> script, using its
    NavMeshAgent. This is used by referencing the position of the player
    and setting that position as the destination of the agent.
