  <h3><i>Player moves around in the level</i></h3>
  <h2>Original</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The dragon's head tracks the player</li>
    <li>The dragon slowly walks toward the player's position, but stays within a designated radius of its original position</li>
    <li>A fireball gets shot from the dragon's mouth periodically at the player</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>

	<h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    We don't have the dragon's head tracking the player, instead the
    dragon's entire body follows the player as it moves. We also removed
    the restriction on having the dragon stay close to the gate, it will
    instead follow the player all over the arena. There is no escape from
    Terry the Terrible.
  </p>
  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    <a href="../parts/avatar.html">Player</a> is controlled by the 
    FirstPersonController script (standard asset) attached to the player. Uses 
    standard controls, wasd, shift for sprint, space for jump.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dragon moving towards the player is handled by the Chase method in
    the <a href="../parts/dragon.html#dragonAI">DragonAI</a> script, using its
    <a href="../parts/dragon.html#nav_mesh_agent">NavMeshAgent</a>. This is 
    used by referencing the position of the player and setting that position 
    as the destination of the agent.
