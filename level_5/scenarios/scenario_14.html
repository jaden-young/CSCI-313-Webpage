  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    This scenario is triggered by the box collider marked as a trigger
    attached to the <a href="../parts/chest.html">Chest</a> in its
    OnTriggerEnter method. The ChestController script then calls its
    open method, as well as the 
    <a href="../parts/ranch_bottle.html">BottleOfRanchController</a>'s 
    RaiseBottle method. When the bottle of ranch is done rising out of
    the chest, the 
    <a href="../parts/level_five_manager.html">LevelFiveManager</a>
    script will return the player to the main menu.
