  <h3><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="../parts/dragon.html">Dragon's</a> death method causes
    the dragon to cease chasing the player and play a death animation and 
    sound effect. The DragonAI script then calls the
    <a href="../parts/gate.html">Gate's</a> open method to open the gate,
    playing appropriate animation and sound effect.
