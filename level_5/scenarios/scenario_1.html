  <h2>Actual</h2>
  <p>
    The only thing we implemented to happen upon player entry is having
    the dragon roar.
  </p>
  <h2><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h2>
  <p>
    Make use of the <a href="../parts/dragon.html">Dragon's</a> Start method, 
    which is called when the dragon enters the game, i.e. at the very beginning
    of the level. The dragon stops chasing the player, and plays its roar
    animation and sound effect.
