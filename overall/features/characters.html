    The main character is a knight who lost his memory due to some unknown accident. This is who is under the control of the player.

    There is a voice in the form of text boxes that is heard throughout the game directing the player on what to expect next and to bring the character closer to the boss level.
    There is no picture available as the player will not know what the voice looks like until the final level of the game.
