  <h4>Rules</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A player is given 3 lives to start the game. They lose a life by dying during that level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a player loses all of their lives, they must start over at first level.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player will gain points as he goes through each level
        and they will collect into a total score either when the player dies or when the player wins the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        A player can collect collectibles (ranch bottles) during each level to be used as a multipler at the end of each level.
      <li>
        Once a player completes a level, another life is added to the amount of lives they have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each level decided how the player will lose a life.
      </li>

      </ul>
