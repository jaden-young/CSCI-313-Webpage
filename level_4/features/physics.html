      There isn't a whole lot of physics involved with minesweeper because everything in the game is stationary. The only kind of physics that was used was making sure that the tiles stayed on the grid and didn't fall off.

  <p>
    The physics in Simon are minimal as the user is not moving a character in the game. Physics are used to hold the object in place and so it isn't falling in the 3D space. Otherwise, nothing in the game moves.
