    <h4>MineSweeper</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The overall goal is to click on all of the tiles in the grid that don't contain mines. When a tile has been clicked on and other adjacent tiles have changed colors, the tiles that are left that haven't changed colors, but are adjacent to the tiles that have changed colors could contain mines, so the player has to think about how to carefully click on a tile that doesn't contain a mine.
      </li>
      <li>
	The main rule is that you can only click on one tile at a time, because once you click on a tile, it will change color and either the tiles that are nearby will change colors too meaning that they contain no mines, or the tile that was clicked on contains a mine, which in that case, the game has been lost. When all of the tiles that don't contain a mine have been clicked on, the game has been won and the option to play again or to return to the start menu will appear. The same options will appear for when the game has been lost.
      </li>
      <li>
 	The other rule is that the game has to be completed within 30 seconds, or else the game has been lost and you will be returned to the main menu.
      </li>
