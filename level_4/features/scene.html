    <p>
      The scene for Simon is a circle with four different colored blocked. The blocks will light up in a certain pattern that the user is able to repeat back to gain a score. The user will get three wrong tries before the game ends.
    <p>
      The scene is just a grid filled with tiles against a solid blue background. The grid contains labels that display the number of mines left, and whether the game has been won or lost, the timer, and two buttons that give the option to restart the game or return to the main menu. The player can set up the number of tiles and mines as well as the time limit before starting the game. When the mouse hovers over the tile, then the tile turns to a darker green color, and when the mouse stops hovering over the tile, then the tile turns a lighter green color. When a tile is clicked on, then it turns pink.
