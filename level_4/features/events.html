    <h1>Level 4 - Puzzle</h1>
    <hr><i>Things that trigger actions</i></hr>
    <p>
      Once the level has started, a screen will pop up that will display the instructions for the level.
    <p>      
      Once the player moves within the maze and approaches and interacts with the puzzle door, the scene will 
      transition from the maze to the 2D version of the first puzzle, the memory puzzle. And then the puzzle will start.
    <p>
      Within the memory puzzle, whenever the mouse clicks on a card, the card flips over. When another card is clicked to be 
      flipped over, both of the cards get compared and if they are a match, then they stay faced up and a score is added. 
      If not, then they both return to its original state, which was faced down. After each attempt, total number of lives are 
      either added or deducted from the overall player's lives.
    <p>
      When the puzzle has been won, then the scene transitions from the 2D puzzle to the maze and the avatar will appear again
      and it will be free to move forward in the maze and onto the next puzzle. And the total score from that puzzle will be 
      added to the overall player score.
    <p>
      When the puzzle has been lost, then the scene transitions from the 2D puzzle to the maze and the avatar will appear again
      however, the avatar will be placed at the beginning of the maze and will be forced to start all over again.
    <p>
      When the avatar interacts with the second puzzle door, the scene will transition from the maze to the 2D version of the 
      Simon Says puzzle and then the puzzle will start.
    <p>
      When the Simon Says puzzle starts, then the board displays a sequence. When the mouse clicks on the correct sequence,
      then the board produces a new sequence and it will do that until the number of sequences have been played out. If the 
      sequence is not correct at any point, the board repeats the sequence so that it can be clicked on correctly. After each 
      attempt, total number of lives are either added or deducted from the overall player's lives.
    <p> 
      When the puzzle has been won, then the scene transitions from the 2D puzzle to the maze and the avatar will appear again
      and it will move in the maze towards the end of the maze and onto the next level. And the total score and lives from that 
      puzzle will be added to the overall player score.
    <p>
      When the puzzle has been lost, then the scene transitions from the 2D puzzle to the maze and the avatar will appear again
      however, the avatar will be placed at the point in the maze where it was at before the simon says puzzle started and will 
      be forced to start all over again.
    <p>
      When the level has been completed, the scene will transition to the next level and the contents of level 4 will disappear,
      but the player's score and lives that it gained through the level will be carried on to the next level.
