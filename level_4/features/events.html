      Once the level has started, a screen will pop up that will display the instructions for the level.
    <p>
      Within the minesweeper game, the player clicks on a tile. When the mouse hovers over a tile, it changes color until it's
      clicked on, then it will turn pink, indicating that the tile has been clicked on. If the tile that was clicked on contains
      no mines and if the adjacent tiles have no mines, then the adjacent tiles will change to a pink color. If the tile
      that was clicked on has no mines, but there are adjacent tiles with mines, then those adjacent tiles will not change colors
      to pink. If the player clicks on a tile with a mine, then the other tiles with mines are revealed by changing colors
      to pink and then the game is over at that point. The player loses by clicking on a tile with a mine. If the player
      manages to click on all of the tiles that contain no mines, then the player has won the game and the game is over.

      The player loses by clicking on a tile with a mine.
    <p>
      If the player
      manages to click on all of the tiles that contain no mines, then the player has won the game and the game is over.
    <p>
      If the time limit has been reached while playing the game, the game stops and returns to the main menu.
    <p>

      When the Simon Says puzzle starts, then the board displays a sequence. When the mouse clicks on the correct sequence,
      then the board produces a new sequence and it will do that until the player has made 3 mistakes. If the
      sequence is not correct at any point, the board repeats the sequence so that it can be clicked on correctly.
    <p>
      When the player has lost all his/her tries, the game will display their score to the user and allow the user to go back to the start menu.
