      For audio, the background music that was used in the main menu will be the audio that will be prevalent throughout the 
      level but at a lower volume.
    <p>
      During the Memory game, the only audio that would be involved would be when two cards that are flipped are a match.
    <p>
      During the Simon Says game, the only audio that would be involved would be when the sequence is repeated correctly.
    <p>
      Another possible use for audio would be when each puzzle has completed, either when it has been won or lost. Or for when 
      the overall level has been completed, as well as when the avatar encounters, or comes close to a puzzle door within the maze.
