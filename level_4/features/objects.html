      The objects in MineSweeper consist of a grid and a tile. The grid was an empty object turned into a prefab, and the tile was a cube then turned into a prefab. The grid is basically filled with multiple tiles and three labels. One label displays the time, another displays the count of mines left, and the other labe displays if you've won or lost the game. There are also buttons that display on the grid when the game has been lost or won and they give the player the option to restart the game or to go back to the main menu. The tiles themselves also light up to a darker green color when the mouse is hovered over it and when the mouse has stopped hovering over that tile, it turns to a lighter green color indicating that it's a vacant tile. And when the tile is clicked on, it changes to the color pink, and that indicates whether it's a mined tile or not.
