  <h1>Level 4-Puzzle</h1>
  <h3> Player Clicks on Card with another Card flipped</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Presepective </i></h4>
  <p>The Player will be viewing a game board with 8 cards on it and at least 1 card face up. The player will start this scenario by clicking on another card.
  <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>
  <img src=Images/CardAlreadyFlipped.png width=50%>
<p>The memory Manager will see the mouse click and will tell the card that was clicked on to flip over so the player can see it. The memory manager will than get the cards info (picture/number/shape) so it can be compared to the next card that is flipped. The update method will be notified that two cards are face up. The memory manager will than call compare to compare the two cards so see if they have the same picture/number/shape. If the cards are the same, they will stay face up and points will be added. If the cards are different, they will be flipped and 1 try will be removed.
