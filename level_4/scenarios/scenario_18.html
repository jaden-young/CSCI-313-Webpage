  <h1>Level 4-Puzzle</h1>
  <h3> Player Clicks On a Tile With a Mine</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Perspective </i></h4>
  <p>The player clicks on a random tile with a mine underneath it and then the game stops and is lost. The other mined tile is revealed as well.
    <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>
      <img src=Images/tileWithMine.png width=50%>
    <p>The tile will uncover and if there is a mine underneath it, the grid will call its update method to check the number of mines or to check if the number of uncovered tiles is equal to the number of tiles minus the number of mines. In that case the, the game is over and the player can either restart the game or return to the main menu.
