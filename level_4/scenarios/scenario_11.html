  <h1>Level 4-Puzzle</h1>
  <h3> Player clicks on incorrect picture</h3>
  <h4><i>Player's Presepective </i></h4>
  <p> The player will have clicked on a picture and it will not be the correct one for the sequence
    <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>

    <img src="Images/SimonSaysIncorrectPic.png" width="50%">

    <p>The board will be notified if the picture was clicked on and the picture will send the needed info to check if it was the right picture. Since it is incorrect, the board will tell  the Simon Says Manager so it can deduct a try. The Simon Says will than show the sequence to the user again. The player will need to repeat the whole sequence again.
