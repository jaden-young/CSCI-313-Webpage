  <h3> Player Collides with Puzzle Door</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Presepective </i></h4>
  <p>The player will be walking through the maze and will collide with the puzzle door
    <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>
      <img src=Images/CollidesDoor.png width=50%>
    <p>The update method in Level Builder will be calling the Avatar's update and that will detect the collision with the Puzzle door. The Puzzle Door will than notify the Level Builder that the avatar has reached it. The Level Builder will than hide the Avatar and the Maze and switch to the Puzzle Manager (either the Memory Manager or Simon Says Manager based on which one it collides with).
