  <h3> Player Clicks on Card without another Card Flipped</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Presepective </i></h4>
  <p>The player will be viewing a game board with 8 cards on the board. The player will select one of the cards by clicking on it with the mouse.
    <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>
      <img src=Images/ClicksOnCard.png width=50%>
    <p>The memory Manager will see the mouse click and will tell the card that was clicked on to flip over so the player can see it. The memory manager will than get the cards info (picture/number/shape) so it can be compared to the next card that is flipped.
