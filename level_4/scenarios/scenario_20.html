  <h3> Player Runs Out of Time</h2>
  <h4><i>Player's Perspective </i></h4>
  <p>The time limit has been reached and the game has stopped and player loses the game.
    <h4><i>Developer's Perspective</i></h4>
      <img src=Images/runsOutOfTime.png width=50%>
    <p>The time taken to play the game is more than the time limit that was set initially, so the grid exits out of itself and returns to the main menu.
