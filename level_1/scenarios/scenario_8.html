  <h1>Level 1 - Racer</h1>
  <h3><i>Driving in the Grass</i></h3>
  <ol>
  <p>Throughout the racetrack the player will be racing on gravel and will maintain a consistent speed as long as they stay on that surface. Along the edges there will be grass. If a player steers off course and onto the grass they will slow down until returning to the gravel surface. </p>
