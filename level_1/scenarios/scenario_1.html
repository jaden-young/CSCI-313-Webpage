  <p>The player will be greeted by a screen that shows the instructions for the level. After clicking the "okay" button, the screen will go black and they will appear as a wagon. The view will be from a third person perspective so they can see the avatar they are controlling. The landscape will also be drawn when this happens. Users will see themselves on a dirt road with the view of the track ahead of them.</p>
