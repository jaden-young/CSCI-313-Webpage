  <h1>Level 1 - Racer</h1>
  <h3><i>Player collides with a structure</i></h3>
  <ol>
  <p>While racing through the level, players will be greeted with obstacles scattered on and around the track. These obstacles (structures) will cause the player to come to a complete stop when collided into. Structures include buildings, trees, and cows. Cows are included in structures because they will have the same effect on the player as other structures except they will disppear after they have been collided with.</p>
