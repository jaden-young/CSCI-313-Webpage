  <h3><i>Player driving through a puddle</i></h3>
  <ol>
  <p>When a player is racing through the level, numerous puddles will be dispersed across the landscape. If a player drives over one, their wagon will spin out and come to a stop prompting the player to lose time as they try to make their way to the end of the level.</p>
