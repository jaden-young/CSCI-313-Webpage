  <h3><i>Dying in the Game</i></h3>
  <ol>
  <p>In this game there are 3 ways that your player can die. One way is falling off the track completely, in this event the avatar will restart the race and lose one life. You can also die while racing on the course, and the last way is if the race timer runs out it essentially like dying and you will restart and lose a life.</p>
