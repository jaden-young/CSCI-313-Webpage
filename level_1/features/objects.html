      <p>
        Objects in this game will vary a considerable amount in terms of
        what they do and how they affect the game. Structures will be the
        most common type of object. The structures will serve as obstacles
        during the race and also as scenery. So there will be bigger objects
        like walls and buildings and smaller ones like bushes and puddles all
        with varying effects on the gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collectibles will come in the
        form of coins (bottles of ranch) and will add time on clock.
        Throughout the course there will be a few areas that contain speed
        boosts. Getting to these areas will be more difficult so determining
        if they are worth it is up to the player.
