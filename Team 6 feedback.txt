Level 1 Racer:
scenarios are listed in detail.
could have added explanation for object diagrams and calls being made.

Level 2 Side Scroller:
Player gets hit: explanation is same for both developer and player.
some of the object diagrams are incomplete
overall object diagram is good

Level 3-Battle
Player Starts Level 3: object diagram is not clear
Player Gets Hit: no collision detection mentioned, no enemy object mentioned
very short description for each scenario.

Level 4- Puzzle
good detail scenarios and clear explanation. 

Level 5 - Boss Battle
good list of scenarios
No explanation on object diagram for some scenarios
No diagrams for some scenarios


Overall good effort. good job from game complexity perspective.
But "Overall scenarios" pages are not working, start of the game, end of the game scenarios are missing
